# BinarySearch

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.

ONLY WORKS ON SORTED LISTS

It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one. O(log n)

For large lists it is much more effecient than a sequetial search through every item. O(n)
